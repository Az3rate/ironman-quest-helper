Sand Crab Timer is a third-party RuneLite plugin designed to assist players training at sand crabs by visually tracking aggression timers, idle timeouts, and providing customizable alert options. It's a minimal yet powerful overlay tool optimized for AFK training scenarios.

## Current State

The plugin is stable and ready for use. It provides core features aimed at improving awareness during sand crab training, especially for AFK-style gameplay.

### Implemented Features

- Tracks the standard 10-minute aggression window (configurable)
- Tracks idle time since last combat hit
- Displays a dynamic overlay showing:
  - Countdown bar for aggression expiry
  - Idle timer
  - Optional alert when aggression or idle threshold is reached
- Configurable RuneLite sound ID for alerts (with link to wiki for IDs)
- Optional looping AFK sound when idle
- Manual reset toggle to restart timers
- Visual hint when crabs lose aggression ("reload map to reset crabs")
- Live config display (which features are enabled) directly in overlay
